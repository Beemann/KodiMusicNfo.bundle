# KodiMusicNfo.bundle
Imports fields from kodi artist.nfo &amp; album.nfo into Plex music library.

Two example files for artist.nfo + album.nfo show the additions to kodi fields to support similar artists and concerts in artist.nfo. Note the favourite tracks in PLex are obtained from the track.rating values in album.nfo across all tracks for that artist.
